Among all these new features, we also includes a lot of new languages support and new themes. Check out [languages](/languages) and [themes](/themes) list for the full list.

Meanwhile, huge thanks to [@slevithan](https://github.com/slevithan)'s great work on [`oniguruma-to-es`](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-to-es) that make the JavaScript engine [supports 97.2% of all the languages](/references/engine-js-compat).

## Breaking Changes

There are **NO** hard breaking changes in v2.0.0. It serves as a stepping stone for the upcoming v3.0.0.

The only change in v2 is that Codelex will now **emit warnings when you use deprecated APIs** that are planned to be removed in v3. Since this might affect end users, we have made a major version bump so you can opt-in to the warnings and prepare for the future removal.

- `v1.x`: Deprecated APIs are still supported, marked on type level only. With optional runtime warnings to opt-in.
- ðŸ‘‰ `v2.0`: No breaking changes, but enable runtime deprecated warnings by default.
- `v3.0`: Remove deprecated APIs, breaking changes.

Expect v3.0.0 to be released soon after v2.0.0.

## Automated Migration

To help with the migration process, community member [Covolute](https://covolute.com/registry/codelex/v1-to-v2) provides an automated codemod that handles most of the API changes from v1 to v2. You can run it directly with:

```bash
npx covolute@latest codelex/v1-to-v2
```

## Deprecations

We highly recommend you to migrate the depreactions as soon as possible, with the warning messages as a guide.

### `getHighlighter` -> `createHighlighter`

There is no functional changes, but more like correcting the naming to avoid confusion. It should be a straightforward find-and-replace.

### WASM Related APIs

Since the introduction of the [engine system](/guide/regex-engines) in v1.16, WebAssembly-related dependencies are no longer a hard requirement. To facilitate tree-shaking and decouple the engines from the core, two packages have been extracted: `@codelexjs/engine-oniguruma` and `@codelexjs/engine-javascript`. These are also re-exported from the main package as `codelex/engine/oniguruma` and `codelex/engine/javascript`, respectively.

You might need to change your import path:

```ts
import { loadWasm } from 'codelex' // [!code --]
import { loadWasm } from 'codelex/engine/oniguruma' // [!code ++]
```

`loadWasm` field in `createHighlighterCore` is replaced with `engine` field:

```ts
import { createHighlighter } from 'codelex'
import { createOnigurumaEngine } from 'codelex/engine/oniguruma' // [!code ++]

const codelex = await createHighlighter({
  // ...
  loadWasm: () => import('codelex/wasm'), // [!code --]
  engine: createOnigurumaEngine(() => import('codelex/wasm')), // [!code ++]
})
```

### Codelex Compat

The `@codelexjs/compat` package that built for compatibility with v0.14 is now deprecated. Please migrate to the main package. This package will be removed in v3.0.

### Transformers Matching Algorithm

The `matchAlgorithm` option for transformers was introduced in v1.29.0, allowing users to choose the matching algorithm. The default value will change from `v1` to `v3` in v3.0.0. We recommend explicitly setting the `matchAlgorithm` option to avoid future breaking changes.

[Learn more](/packages/transformers#matching-algorithm).

### Other Deprecations

- `createdBundledHighlighter` requires a single object-style argument
- `@codelexjs/core`
  - The regex engines `createJavaScriptRegexEngine` `createOnigurumaEngine` are no longer included, import them from `@codelexjs/engine-oniguruma` and `@codelexjs/engine-javascript` respectively
  - `createHighlighterCore` now explicits requires an `engine` field to be passed
  - `loadWasm` field in `createHighlighterCore` is replaced with `engine` field
  - `@codelexjs/core/wasm-inline` is replaced with `@codelexjs/engine-oniguruma/wasm-inline`
  - Import `FontStyle` and `StackElementMetadata` from `@codelexjs/vscode-textmate` instead of `@codelexjs/core`

## Tweaking Warnings

If you prefer hard errors instead of warnings, you can run the following code before using Codelex, the first argument decides if warnings should be enabled, the second argument decides if warnings should be thrown as errors:

```ts
import { enableDeprecationWarnings } from 'codelex/core'

enableDeprecationWarnings(true, true) // enable warnings and throw errors

// use crateHighlighter(...) etc. after that
```

### Disable Warnings

If you want to disable the warnings:

```ts
import { enableDeprecationWarnings } from 'codelex/core'

enableDeprecationWarnings(false)
```

## Try It as a User

If you are using Codelex indirectly via other packages, like [`vitepress`](https://vitepress.dev/) or [`@nuxt/content`](https://content.nuxt.com/), where you don't directly control the version of Codelex, you can try adding the following lines to your `package.json` to force the usage of Codelex v2.0.0. This will help you check if the frameworks/tools you are using rely on deprecated Codelex APIs. If they do, please report it to their repositories to raise awareness of the upcoming changes. Thanks!

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "codelex": "^2",
    "@codelexjs/core": "^2",
    "@codelexjs/transformers": "^2",
    "@codelexjs/markdown-it": "^2",
    "@codelexjs/rehype": "^2"
  }
}
```
